# PC-Gamer Store

Front-End of a Single Page Application, a Store of Gaming Pcs build with **ReactJS**, in this project i profonded my knowledge about components and Routing in React, the use of localStorage to avoid loosing infos when actualizing the page.

Done the management State of the Cart with her various actions (Add items with various quantities and delete them from the Cart) using **Redux**, and in the last i combined the reducers and use lodash.throttle to minimize the high frequences of saving states.
