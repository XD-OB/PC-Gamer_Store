# PC-Gamer_Store
Front-End of a Single Page Application, a Store of Gaming Pcs build with ReactJS, in this project i profonded my knowledge about components and Routing in React, the use of localStorage to avoid loosing infos when actualizing the page, and done the management State of the Cart with her various actions (Add items with various quantities and delete them from the Cart) using Redux, and in the last i combined the reducers and use lodash.throttle to minimize the high frequences of saving states.
